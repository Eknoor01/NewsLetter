                    <p>Madan doesn’t do too badly as an independent-minded Marathi mulgi who
                         can teach a thing or two to her old man (you only wish she would stop speaking
                          between her teeth), and the script takes care to insert her into as many scenes as
                           it can. But it fails when it comes to the two men who were his closest partners and companions on the journey to create the airline: 
                           ‘Sarfira’ keeps them in the background, and they only come into their own, just a bit, towards the end. The excellent Seema Biswas,
                            playing Akshay’s mother, is reduced to a wailing Bollywood 
                        maa; Belawadi is oily to the right degree,
                         but is entirely forgotten after his short arc.</p>

                        Gautam Gambhir has requested the BCCI to consider former South Africa pacer Morne Morkel as Team India's bowling coach, reported Cricbuzz on Thursday.
                         Morkel is the latest to float after Vinay Kumar and Zaheer Khan. The BCCI was not too keen on roping in Vinay Kumar. According to media reports, discussions have taken place on Zaheer,
                         but now Gambhir has shown his interest in Morkel, who was Pakistan's bowling coach during the ODI World Cup in India last year but ended his contract 
                         with PCB prematurely after the tournament ended.
                         <br><br>
                         The report added that BCCI has already held discussions with Morkel, who currently lives with his family in Australia. A final decision, however, might take some time. 
                         If the board fails to finalise India's next batting bowling and fielding coaches in the next week or so, VVS Laxman's NCA support staff might fly with Gambhir for the
                          Sri Lanka tour, which starts with the T20I series on July 26.
                        <br>
                            Along with head coach Rahul Dravid, batting coach Vikram Rathour, bowling coach Paras Mhambrey, and fielding coach T Dilip, their te
                            nures also ended with the T20 World Cup. Dilip, however, might get an extension.
